# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
```
Pretty confident, they work very similar to the way the symbols are used in math.
```
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
```
Confident. I would like to see how much further you can take them. Like can you compare more that 2 statements are a time?
```
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
```
I feel good about these. The exercise with the bear_choices was neat to follow. I'm excited to get to a point where I build something that is actually interactable.
```
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
```
I think it took me around 2 hours. I split it up between two evenings. There were so many more parts to it than previous lessons. It was a good lesson and it caught me by surprise as the length was more than I expected.
```
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
```
I want more practice on using the comparison operators just so that I won't forget about them. I have to build in that practice and review time.
```
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
```
No questions right now. I was able to find answers through google when I had them.
